Almost all times when I get this idea my usual reply is: "What? There are so many out there I'll hardly make a contribution!". Turns out I was wrong in about this. I thought about writing for others rather than myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That changed and here is why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many good reasons to start a blog: to show of the cool stuff you're doing, to remember stuff, to get better at explaining complicated things to a critical audience and probably others. By writing about a specific experience you tend to organize your thoughts in a sistematic way which will be dumped in a nice and clean blog post that can be digested by some people that never have time to read your posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this 'wisdom' maybe common knowledge for others, but for me this is new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my posts will be related to Python coding encounters the new Go programming language adventures and C. I'm a web coder so most of the things about these languages and libraries related to them will be revolving around the web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is to a new adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="general"></category></entry></feed>
