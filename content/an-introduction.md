Summary: An introduction about this blog

I was thinking of starting a blog about my coding experiences many times. Almost all times when I get this idea my usual reply is: "What? There are so many out there I'll hardly make a contribution!". Turns out I was wrong in about this. I thought about writing for others rather than myself.

That changed and here is why.

There are many good reasons to start a blog: to show of the cool stuff you're doing, to remember stuff, to get better at explaining complicated things to a critical audience and probably others. By writing about a specific experience you tend to organize your thoughts in a sistematic way which will be dumped in a nice and clean blog post that can be digested by some people that never have time to read your posts.

All this 'wisdom' maybe common knowledge for others, but for me this is new.

Most of my posts will be related to Python coding encounters the new Go programming language adventures and C. I'm a web coder so most of the things about these languages and libraries related to them will be revolving around the web technologies.

So here is to a new adventure.
